# DSA

Welcome to the dsa repository! This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from various sources.


## Introduction

This repository is a collection of solved problems from various platforms like LeetCode, hackerRank, Youtube, etc. Contains question and follow a specific order of naming.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. Recursion: Contains solutions of problems related to recursion and iteration.
2. Arrays: Contains solutions of problems related to arrays.
3. Conversions: Contains solutions of problems related to conversion of 1 type to another.

## Naming Convention

Each question is named via a character and digits specifing number at which it is given in problem chart and what problem is given.
example: recursion problem 7 will be like - (r007). r defining recursion and 007 defining 7th question from question chart.

## Solution Structure

Each folder contains multiple solved problems. The structure of solution follows:

1. Question
2. Main class
3. Sample Input/Output
4. Approach
5. Time Complexity
6. Space Complexity
